# RPSLSGame

## Overview
This is a .NET 7.0 Web API project that implements the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," inspired by the popular TV show *The Big Bang Theory*. The project demonstrates a modular architecture with clearly defined services for game logic, random choice generation, and result tracking.

## Features
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints to retrieve available choices, generate a random choice, play a round against the computer, view recent game results, and reset the scoreboard.
- **Modular Architecture**: Implements a clean and maintainable architecture with separate services and interfaces for core functionalities such as game logic, random choice generation, and result tracking.
- **React Frontend Integration**: Features a modern React frontend that interacts with the backend API, displaying game results, recent scores, and allowing user interaction.
- **Docker Support**: Includes Docker configuration for easy containerization and deployment of the application.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling across both the frontend and backend, ensuring a seamless user experience even in cases of failure.
- **Unit Testing**: Extensive unit tests cover core functionalities of the API and services, ensuring reliability and facilitating continuous integration.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/choices
Returns a list of available choices: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock.

### GET /api/choice
Returns a random choice generated by a third-party service.

### POST /api/play
Plays a round of the game against the computer. The player submits their choice, and the API returns the result.

#### Request:
```json
{
    "player": choice_id
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
    "results": "win/lose/tie",
    "player": {
        "name": "rock",
        "image": "/images/rock.png"
    },
    "computer": {
        "name": "paper",
        "image": "/images/paper.png"
    }
}
```
