# RPSLSGame

## Overview
This is a .NET 7.0 Web API project that implements the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," inspired by the popular TV show *The Big Bang Theory*. The project demonstrates a microservices architecture that replaces a legacy monolithic system.

## Features
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints to retrieve available choices, get a random choice, and play a round against the computer.
- **Modern Architecture**: Implements a scalable microservices architecture.
- **Optional UI**: Allows the possibility of replacing the legacy UI with a modern React frontend (if implemented).
- **Docker Support**: Includes a Dockerfile for containerization.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/choices
Returns a list of available choices: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock.

### GET /api/choice
Returns a random choice generated by a third-party service.

### POST /api/play
Plays a round of the game against the computer. The player submits their choice, and the API returns the result.

#### Request:
```json
{
    "player": choice_id
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
    "results": "win/lose/tie",
    "player": choice_id,
    "computer": choice_id
}
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RPSLSGame.git
    cd RPSLSGame
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:
    - Open the project in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

3. **Run the Project**:
    - You can run the project using the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

4. **Docker Setup (Optional)**:
    - Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t rpsls-game .
    ```
    - Run the Docker container:
    ```bash

    ```

## Technology Stack
- **.NET 7.0**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Docker** (Optional)
- **React** (Optional)

## Future Improvements
- Implement a scoreboard with the last 10 results.
- Allow multiple users to play on the same service.
- Enhance security measures (e.g., authentication, input validation).

## Credits
- Game rules based on the "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" game by Sam Kass.
- API design inspired by the *The Big Bang Theory* episode featuring the game.
